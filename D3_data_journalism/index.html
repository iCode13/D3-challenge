          <h2>Relationships Between Health Markers and Poverty, Age and Income Revealed by 2014 U.S. States Data</h2>
          <p>Data for this study is sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau and Behaviorial Risk Factor Surveillance System. 
            In order to visualize the data, please select from the six available headings. For each combination that one selects, 
            the circles representing the state data adjusts, and reflects state statistics for that specific selection on the plot. 
            State specific statistics are displayed on hovering over the small circles representing each state.</p>

          <p>The interactive scatter plots reveal the following:</p>

          <p>1. An overall positive correlation exists between poverty and the three health risk factors. With increase in poverty,
            percentages of obese and smokers are higher, and there is lesser access to healthcare.</p>

          <p>2. No correlation is seen between age and obesity, as well as smoking. However, there seems to be a negative correlation 
            between age and lack of healthcare, meaning people have increased access to healthcare as they age.</p>
          
          <p>3. An overall positive correlation exists between household income and the three health risk factors. As household income rises, 
            percentages of obese and smokers are lower, and there is greater access to healthcare.</p>
